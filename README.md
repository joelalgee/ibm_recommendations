# IBM Watson Studio Article Recommendations

Recommending articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, using Python

## Summary

In this project, I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and made recommendations to them about new articles they might like. This project had a series of predefined steps to follow, with the analysis for each step needing to be coded. Several techniques were explored - EDA, rank based recommendations, user-user based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization.

The data, and the custom packages for evaluation cannot be shared, so the only file available here is Recommendations_with_IBM.html, a static HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook file. The data is included for reference.
